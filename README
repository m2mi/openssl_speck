OpenSSL SPECK

Speck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013.[3] Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add-rotate-xor (ARX) cipher. The NSA began working on the Simon and Speck ciphers in 2012. The agency anticipated some agencies in the US federal government would need a cipher that would operate well on a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices while maintaining an acceptable level of security. Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add-rotate-xor (ARX) cipher.

This open source project provides an implementation of OpenSSL with the Speck block cipher that can be used by IoT developers. The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS) as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library.
