> make

Modifications:

- Add speck.h in /include/openssl/ to define API methods for Speck

- Modify c_allc.c in /crypto/evp to make Speck 128/256 CBC cipher availabel in libcrypto (line 214)

- Modify evp.h in /include/openssl/ to define EVP Speck cipher (line 826)

- Created speck directory in /crypto with:

	- speck.c containing main code with Speck low-level implementations
	- speck_locl.h containing headers for speck.c file
	- speck_cbc.c calling CBC impementations
	- speck_misc.c containg API implemtations calling low-level implementations

- Modify tls1.h in /include/openssl to define the Speck ciphersuites using IDs reserved for private use as defined in RFC5246

- Modify s3_lib.c in /ssl to define the implementations of the Speck ciphersuites.

- Modify ssl_locl.h to define the Bitmask SSL_SPECK128 for SSL_CIPHER.algorithms
